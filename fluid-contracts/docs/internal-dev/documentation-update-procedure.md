# Documentation Update Procedure

To ensure our documentation remains current with the latest developments, follow this streamlined process:

Generate Documentation: Initiate by running the `npx hardhat docgen` command in your terminal. This action generates a new set of documentation files.

Locate Generated Files: Navigate to the `docs` directory. Here, you'll find a newly created `contracts` folder containing the updated documentation.

Now replace all `# Solidity API` line with empty space. You can do it with CTRL + SHIFT + H (Windows).

Copy Updated Documentation: Transfer the contents from `docs/contracts/src/contracts` into the `fluid-docs` repository, specifically to the `content/3.contracts/3.docs/` directory.

If there are any new changes to the components listed below, please follow these steps:

1. Copy and paste the relevant sections from the autogenerated documentation.
2. Update the appropriate documentation files located under:
   - `Core Contracts` at `content/3.contracts/1.core contracts/`
   - `Periphery Contracts` at `content/3.contracts/2.periphery contracts/`
