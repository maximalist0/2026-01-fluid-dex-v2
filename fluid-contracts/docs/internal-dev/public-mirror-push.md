# Push to public mirror repo guide

The following steps must be taken to push a new state to the public mirror fluid contracts repo (https://github.com/Instadapp/fluid-contracts-public):

Just push to the origin/mirror-public-repo branch. The CI script in `.github/workflows/public-release.yml` takes care of removing folders that should not be in the public repo and squashes down everything into a new commit. The commit message shown in the public repo will be the same as when pushing to the public mirror branch.

If needed, you might have to adjust the files & folders that are removed. Currently, the script removes the following:

- whole scripts folder
- deployments/ polygon related files
- .github/workflows/public mirror yml
- .gas-report and .gas-snapshot
- docs/deployment.md, push to public mirror guide, autogenerated docs guide
